## IMPORTANT
Do take into account that this Analysis is not a direct and accurate Analysis on the Philippines' economic state. Moreover, predictions in this analysis is not to be considered as accurate. This project is only a showcase of Data Analysis and basic Machine Learning prediction knowledge.

## Introduction

The analysis involves two main objectives:

- **Understanding Key Poverty Indicators**: This study examines agricultural wages, average incomes, and total employment as primary poverty indicators in the Philippines. 
- **Exploring Variable Relationships**: Relationships between variables, such as agricultural wage rates and farm income, non-farm income and rural income, and total employment and total income, are analyzed to uncover patterns and influencing factors.

The datasets used encompass decades of rural poverty data in the Philippines. Utilizing data science methodologies, the study employs Linear Regression to model linear trends and Decision Tree Models to explore categorical relationships. These approaches aim to provide actionable insights for targeted interventions addressing poverty in rural areas.

## Installation

To run the analysis locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Giyanellow/Time-Series-Analysis-on-Philippine-Debt-and-Inflation
   ```
2. Move to main folder
   ```bash

   ```
   
3. Run bash.sh
   ```bash
   bash bash.sh
   ```

## Conclusion

This project concludes that meaningful relationships exist between key poverty indicators and income dynamics within the rural economy of the Philippines. The Linear Regression model effectively captures linear trends, such as the correlation between agricultural wage rates and total income, while the Decision Tree Model excels in identifying categorical influences and critical decision points.

The findings emphasize the Decision Tree Model's superior performance in certain scenarios, particularly in highlighting key factors influencing rural income disparities. The study lays the groundwork for evidence-based policymaking, underscoring the need for targeted interventions to uplift farm households and improve rural economic conditions. Further research with larger datasets and advanced modeling techniques can refine these insights and drive more impactful solutions.
